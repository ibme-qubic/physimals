# Research

### Vision

Rather than seeing medical imaging as just a way to generate
‘pictures’ for inspection, we are seeking to establish imaging as a
means to observe physiological processes when and when they happen, as
they happen, in the human body entirely non-invasively and in a manner
that can be used to study health and disease in people and ultimately
be used in clinical practice to improve patient care.

We are an interdisciplinary group united around the development and
use of image analysis methods for physiological imaging. An important
aspect of our work is the development of software tools that enable
physiological imaging technology to be used in the fundamental
understanding of human biology and physiology, and in patients as part
of clinical trials and clinical practice (see our [software]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/software)) . </p>

### Why Physiological Imaging?

We define physiological imaging as the use of medical imaging
technology to observe physiological (and biological) processes as they
are happening and where they are happening. The resulting images
therefore comprise spatially resolved measurements of processes
happening in the body that are important to normal healthy function,
and disturbed in disease.

Physiological imaging is useful because it is
  
* Specific - focuses on a single physiological parameter (not a mixed contrast of a lot of things that can all vary)
* Absolute - no need for reference tissues or relative values
* Substantial - physiological effect sizes are large in pathology - this is why it is pathological because the physiology has changed
* Modifiable - physiological quantities are things we can seek to
alter and are things we often want to alter with
treatment
