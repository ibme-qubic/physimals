# Online BASIL Course (FSL mini-course) - Pre-course instructions
## 24th November 2020

### Overview

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/basilcourse/cbf.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="25%" style="float: right" />

In the BASIL course you will learn the theory and practice of quantifying and mapping cerebral
perfusion (blood flow) using Arterial Spin Labelling MRI from the
expert team behind BASIL, part of the FMRIB Software Library. On this
page we will provide material to look at *BEFORE* the day of the
course. We strongly recommend you plan to watch the ASL videos in advance. We
also suggest preparatory materials that you might find helpful if you
are new to neuroimaging or FSL tools.

On the day we will be providing machines to work on in the cloud,
complete with all the data and software you will need. You will
interact with expert tutors and other course attendees through Zoom,
or equivalent. We will support you through the practical, hands-on
session.

### Preparatory materials

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/basilcourse/fsl-logo.png" class="img-responsive" width="25%" style="float: left" />

If you are new to Neuroimaging or to FSL tools you might find the
following resources helpful before looking at the material on ASL.

If you are not particularly familar with MRI you might like to
read a (Short Introduction to MRI Physics for Neuroimaging)[http://www.neuroimagingprimers.org/online-appendices/] available
via the neuroimagingprimers.org website.

If you are new to FSL we recommend these three short introductory FSL practicals on [FSLeyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80d9FoqvuGo&list=PLvgasosJnUVku_GE64BfFuftEvh3Y8lHC&index=1), [BET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcjBoqpgACc&index=1&list=PLvgasosJnUVku_GE64BfFuftEvh3Y8lHC), and [FSL Utils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ud6uBuxqXY&list=PLvgasosJnUVku_GE64BfFuftEvh3Y8lHC&index=2).

The [FSL course](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/online_materials.html) provides a wide range of videos and practical
exercises. Whilst you do not need to have looked at any of this before
the BASIL course, you might find some of it helpful background for
topics that will be covered (especially for the group analysis
section).

We would recommend familarity with:
Section 1: Image Registration and Distorition Correction (videos 1-5
are all helpful)
Section 2: Segmentation and Structural Analysis (video 7 on FAST)
Section 4: Statistics & Task fMRI: Inference and Group Analysis (videos
15-20 provide useful background on group analysis)

## ASL videos

To get the most out of the course we strongly recommend you watch the
following videos ahead of time. The aim of the session on the day is
to give you time to perform analyese for youself with support from the
tutors, there will only be a short introduction and not a full
lecture. There is ~90 minutes of material, if you are short of time
you could start by watching video 1 and then 3 (~40 mins), then
selecting the others that interest you.

The full playlist can be accessed below:

## On the day

Before the day you will recieve details for joing the practical
session. This will inlcude details of the Zoom meeting which will be
used to enable discussion between partcipants and course tutors, and a
personal login to a MS Azure cloud-based desktop into which BASIL and
the course data will have been installed. The aim of the session is to
give you the chance to analysis data for yourself with the opportunity
to ask questions from one of our expert team of tutors.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

## Requirements

Each attendee will need to have their own computer (Mac, Windows, Linux) in order to access the cloud based desktop and for video conferencing with tutors in the guided practical sessions. It is therefore essential that you have a reasonable internet connection - one that will allow video conferencing - so most home internet will be fine.  It does not need to be super-fast but we will be relying on it during the practical sessions, and we cannot be responsible for any internet outages or speed problems during the course, although we will do whatever is within our power to provide you with the best service.

## Faculty
   
The course organisers for this course are: Michael Chappell, Mark
Jenkinson and Martin Craig

Tutors on the course have all been trained in BASIL and more generally
the use of FSL at the University of Oxford, and are now primiarly
based in the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre at the University of
Nottingham. The list of tutors is: Michael Chappell, Martin Craig,
Paula Croal, Flora Kennedy McConnell and Moss Zhao.

## Timetable

Two separate pratical sessions will be run, in order to cater for
different timezones. The content for the two sessions will be
identical. You should attedn the session you chose on registration -
you should not switch sessions on the day. If you discover in advance
that you need to change your session choice please contact the
organsiers and we will do our best to accomodate your request.

Session A: 9am-12noon (UK) / 10am-1pm (Europe) / 11am-2pm (Israel) / 12:30pm-3:30pm (Iran) / 1:30-4:30pm (India) / 4pm-7pm (China/Singapore) / 6pm-9pm (Melbourne) / 8pm-11pm (New Zealand)

Session B: 3pm-6pm (UK) / 10am-1pm (East Coast USA) / 7am-10am (West Coast USA)


## After the course

During the course, we will be covering a lot of material in a short
period of time. To make the most of our time together, we have put
together some preparatory material that we recommend you complete before
attending if you are not already familiar with FSL and neuroimaging analysis. 

If you are entirely new to
neuroimaging the course might feel like a lot of new information in a
very short time. Therefore, for those with little or no prior
experience, we strongly recommend the [Introduction to Neuroimaging
Analysis Primer](http://www.neuroimagingprimers.org/) as a very useful introduction.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

If you are looking for additional materials after the
course, we recommend the [Oxford Neuroimaging Primers](http://www.neuroimagingprimers.org/). This bookseries
published by Oxford University Press contains several short
introductions and currently includes: 'Introduction to Neuroimaging
Analysis' and, 'Introduction to Perfusion Quantification using
Arterial Spin Labelling'.
